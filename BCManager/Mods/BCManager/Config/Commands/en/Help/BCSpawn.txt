      Aliases: {commands}
      Default Options: {defaultoptions}
      Usage:
            1. {command} horde
            2. {command} horde <x> <y> <z>
            3. {command} entity <entityClassName>
            4. {command} entity <entityClassName> <x> <y> <z>
      Notes:
            Use bc-help to get a list of common /options
            for all options: with x y z it will target that location
                             without x y z it will target the command giver unless one of the below targeting options is used
                             /player=<name|entityid|steamid> - targets that player
                             /p=x,y,z or /position=x,y,z - targets that location
                             /min=# and /max=# to change the default distance from the target to spawn. 
                             /max must be greater than /min to get valid spawns (/min=0 /max=1 is the closest spawn option)
                             /t=x,y,z or /target=x,y,z - gives the spawns a different moveto target than their spawn target
                             /v=dist,angle or /vector=dist,angle - the spawns will moveto using the distance and angle given
            subcommands:
            horde -  spawns a horde of zombies in a circle around the target
                     use /count=# to set the number to spawn with the command, default is 25
                     use /group=<entitygroupname> to set the group to select entities from, default is ZombiesAll
            entity - spawns a single entity of the <entityClassName>, near the target (default 40-60 blocks distance)
