      Edit existing prefabs with the following sub commands:

      list - list the prefabs in the server prefab folder.
        /dim to also scan and display the size and block count, will take a few secs and lag server, use sparingly.

      clone - create a copy of a prefab with a new filename
      backup - create a copy of a prefab in the backups folder with a timestamp filename in the prefabname subfolder
      restore - restore a copy of a prefab from a backup version. Backups can also be create when changes are made to a prefab
      delete - delete a prefab from the server
      setprop - set a property in the xml. bc-prefab setprop <prefabname> will show all current props, <prefabname> <Property> will give the single value, and <prefabname> <Property> <ValueString> will set a new value and save the xml

      {command} insert - (Work in progress) add a layer in the middle of the prefab, use /x=# or /z=#min,#max etc to specific the layer(s). The prefab size is increased to match
      {command} cut - (Work in progress) remove blocks from a layer, use /x=# or /z=#min,#max etc to specific the layer(s). The prefab size is reduced to match
