    Aliases: {commands}
    Default Options: {defaultoptions}
    Usage:
      1. {command} <partialname | entityid | steamid> <itemname | id> /c=<#> [/min=<#> /max=<#> | /q=<#>]
    Notes:
      Use bc-help to get a list of common /options
      The item will appear in the first open inventory slot, or stack with an existing one.
      If the player inventory is full the item will drop to the ground.
      Item id is the itemclass id, not the item id as it appears in the xml (bc-go itemclasses for a list)
      /min and /max set the min and max for random quality, if either value is not given it will default to 1 for min and 600 for max
      /q will set both min and max to the value given, resulting in an item of that given quality value
      /c (or /count) is the number to give, it can be greater than the item max stack size, and will add multiple items in such a case (even items like guns)
        items with a quality when using count will all have the same quality if a random range is used
      /silent will prevent the receiving player from getting the chat notification of the given item
