      Usage:
            1. {command} <subcommand>
            2. {command} <subcommand> <cx> <cz>
            3. {command} <subcommand> <x> <y> <z>
            4. {command} <subcommand> <cx> <cz> <cx2> <cz2>
            5. {command} <subcommand> <x> <y> <z> <x2> <y2> <z2>
      Notes:
            Use bc-help to get a list of common /options
            Perform actions on the tile entities (loot containers, doors, turrets etc) in the area
            Command with no co-ords will use player location as a chunk position
            <cx> <cz> - chunk co-ordinates. In this mode the entire chunk is part of the area
            <cx2> <cz2> - chunk co-ordinates. The second pair defines an area of chunks
            /r=0-13 - defines a radius if using chunk location. max of 13, 'bc-te scan 0 0 /r=5' would scan the 11x11 chunk grid around 0,0
            /loc - use your current position and a stored loc from bc-loc to define area
            <x> <y> <z> - block position single block, when combined with <x2> <y2> <z2> becomes an area instead
            /id=<steamid> for an online player can be used, if absent the command executor is used instead
            target = the commader, or id=<name|entityid|steamid> player, must be online
            /forcesync - Makes the command execute synchronously which will cause the server to lag until the command completes.
                         Should only be used to get output results from web issued commands rather than pushing to log.
                         Will only work on areas already loaded, the first attempt on an unloaded area will always fail as the chunks can't finish loading until this command finishes.
                         Additional attempts on the same area will work once the chunks finish loading (until the last observer times out).
            Sub Commands:
            scan - scans the defined area and reports on detials of tile entities found
            owner - sets the target as the owner of targeted secure blocks in area
            access - grants access to the target as a user of targeted secure blocks in area
            revoke - removes target player from access list of targeted tiles in area
            lock - locks all targeted secure tiles in area
            unlock - unlocks all targeted secure tiles in area
            empty - removes all loot from targeted tiles in area
            reset - removes all loot and resets touched status so loot tiles become untouched (including player placed blocks)
            additem - add items to a specific loot container, /item=<itemclass id or exact name>, options for /q=1-600 or /c=1-# (if # is more than a stack them multiple stacks will be added)
            removeitem - removes items in the specific loot container, /item=<itemclass id or exact name>, if no /slot=1-# given then smallest stack is reduced, and overflow into extra stacks if required
            remove - DESTROYS all targeted tiles in area. Must use /confirm to execute as there is no undo
