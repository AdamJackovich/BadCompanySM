            Perform actions on the tile entities (loot containers, doors, turrets etc) in the area
            Command with no co-ords will use player location as a chunk position
            <cx> <cz> - chunk co-ordinates. In this mode the entire chunk is part of the area
            <cx2> <cz2> - chunk co-ordinates. The second pair defines an area of chunks
            /r=0-5 - defines a radius if using chunk location. max of 5, 'bc-te scan 0 0 /r=5' would scan the 11x11 chunk grid around 0,0
            <x> <y> <z> - block position single block, when combined with <x2> <y2> <z2> becomes an area instead
            /id=<steamid> for an online player can be used, if absent the command executor is used instead
            target = the commader, or id=<name|entityid|steamid> player, must be online

            additem - add items to a specific loot container, options for /quality=1-600 or /count=1-# (if # is more than a stack them multiple stacks will be added)
