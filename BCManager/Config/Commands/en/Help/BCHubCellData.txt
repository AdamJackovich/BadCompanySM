      Aliases: {commands}
      Default Options: {defaultoptions}
      Usage:
            1. {command} /r=# /o=x,y
            2. {command} <filtertext> /r=# /o=x,y
      Notes:
            Use bc-help to get a list of common /options
            <filtertext> - a string to compare against prefab names, works on partial matches. Leave out to get a full list in the area
                           Example: bc-hcd /o=0,0 /r=1 trader - would find all trader PoIs in the 9 cells around the central cell 0,0
            The first time an area is scanned after a server reboot it will need to load data from disk.
            This is a much slower process compared to using the cache, so it can cause lag on the server while the data is loading.
            Limit the area scanned when running on a server with players.
      Options:
            /o=<x,y> - sets the origin cell for the scan, 0,0 being the central hub, limit between -5 and 6 for a 10k world radius.
                       You can scan further but if the file for those co-ords doesn't exist there will be no results for that cell.
            /r=# - set the radius in cells from the origin, there is no limit but as with the /o any areas scaned with no related file will have no results.
            /full - returns more details. The default view only has prefab name and position, 
                    full option has cell/hub/wilderness rules, townshiptypes, and full lot details such as instance id and rotation
            /reset - clears the cached data. Subsequent calls for data will require reloading from disk.
            /min - strips the field names from the json for the basic output option (i.e doesnt work with /full yet)
