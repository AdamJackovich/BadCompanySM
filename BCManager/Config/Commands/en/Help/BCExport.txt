      Notes:
            1. This command will export the area between your current position and the stored loc (see bc-location)
            2. Alternatively use the 6 numbers to specify two locations and export the area between them.
            Use bc-help to get a list of common /options
            Use bc-location (loc or pos also work) to display and store your current location
            Use bc-prefabs to get a list of prefabs in the Data/Prefabs folder
