      Aliases: {commands}
      Default Options: {defaultoptions}
      Usage:
            1. {command} <filename>
            2. {command} <filename> <cx> <cz>
            3. {command} <filename> <x> <y> <z>
            4. {command} <filename> <cx> <cz> <cx2> <cz2>
            5. {command} <filename> <x> <y> <z> <x2> <y2> <z2>
      Notes:
            Use bc-help to get a list of common /options
            Use bc-location (loc or pos also work) to display and store your current location
            Use bc-go prefabs to get a list of prefabs in the Data/Prefabs folder

            Command with no co-ords will use player location and the loc location, or chunks if /r is used
            <cx> <cz> - chunk co-ordinates. In this mode the entire chunk is part of the area
            <cx2> <cz2> - chunk co-ordinates. The second pair defines an area of chunks
            /r=0-13 - defines a radius if using chunk location. max of 13, 'bc-te scan 0 0 /r=5' would scan the 11x11 chunk grid around 0,0
            /loc - use your current position and a stored loc from bc-loc to define area (default)
            <x> <y> <z> - block position single block, when combined with <x2> <y2> <z2> becomes an area instead
            /forcesync - Makes the command execute synchronously which will cause the server to lag until the command completes.
                         Should only be used to get output results from web issued commands rather than pushing to log.
                         Will only work on areas already loaded, the first attempt on an unloaded area will always fail as the chunks can't finish loading until this command finishes.
                         Additional attempts on the same area will work once the chunks finish loading (until the last observer times out).
