            Command without a param will return all datasets. Be aware this is an extensive list on large servers and may console overload. Use sparingly.
            [partialname] case insensitive. Will search online players only. If more than one player matches will return an error to console, refine your text if this happens.
            [entityid] Will search online players only. Use bc-lpid to get a list of player entityids
            [steamid] Can search for offline players.
