            Use bc-help to get a list of common /options

            /swap - replaces the second block specified with the first block specified within the area given
            /scan - gives stats on blocks within the area given - param * for block name will give stats on all blocks, warning: this will overflow your console if done in a large area
            /undo will override any other param or option and undo the last import
