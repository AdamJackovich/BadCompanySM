      Default Options: {defaultoptions}
      Usage:
            1. {command} <subcommand> <block1> [block2]
            2. {command} <subcommand> <x> <y> <z> <block1> [block2]
            3. {command} <subcommand> <x> <y> <z> <x2> <y2> <z2> <block1> [block2]
      Notes:
            Use bc-help to get a list of common /options
            Command with no co-ords will use player location and the loc location, or chunks if /r is used
            /loc - use your current position and a stored loc from bc-loc to define area (default)
            <x> <y> <z> - block position single block, when combined with <x2> <y2> <z2> becomes an area instead
            <block1> is the name or id of the block to use. asterisk (*) can be used in place of a specific block to process all blocks in area.
            [block2] a second block is also required for the swap command as the block to be replaced by <block1>

            Sub Commands:
            scan - gives stats on blocks within the area given - param * for block name will give stats on all blocks
            fill - the block specified is rendered into the area given or the area between the stored loc (see bc-location) and your current location
                /d=# - the density to use, from -127 to 128. Invalid density wont be applied
                /t=<textureid> - the texture to use, as per the indexes in the paint tool selector
                /delmulti - removes multidim blocks in the area
            swap - replaces the second block specified with the first block specified within the area given. Requires [block2]
                /d=# - the density to use, from -127 to 128. Invalid density wont be applied
                /t=<textureid> - the texture to use, as per the indexes in the paint tool selector
            repair - removes all damage from blocks in the area
            damage - causes damage to blocks in the area
                /d=# | /d=#,# - set the damage to cause, or a randomised range per block
                /nobreak - if the damage would otherwise break the block, instead it will be set to 1 health
                /overkill - the damage given will overflow into downgrade blocks until all damage is allocated or the block becomes air
            upgrade - sets the blocks to the next step in their upgrade path, if any
            downgrade - sets the blocks to the next step in their downgrade path
            paint - paints all sides of blocks in the area
                /t=<textureid> - the texture to use, as per the indexes in the paint tool selector
            paintface - paints one side of blocks in the area
                /t=<textureid> - the texture to use, as per the indexes in the paint tool selector
                /face=0-5 - 0=Top, 1=Bottom, 2=North, 3=West, 4=South, 5=East
            paintstrip - removes all paint from blocks in the area
            density - sets density on blocks in the area
                /d=# - the density to use, from -127 to 128. Invalid density wont be applied
            rotate - rotates blocks in the area
                /rot=# - sets the value for the rotation to apply
